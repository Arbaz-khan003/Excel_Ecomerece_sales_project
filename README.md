# Excel_Ecomerece_sales_project

The project appears to be an E-commerce Sales Analysis focused on exploring and evaluating sales data, profitability, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for an online retail business. The analysis spans several dimensions, including monthly and yearly trends, product categories, and geographic (state-wise) breakdowns.

Here's a brief summary of each relevant sheet:

sales and profit: Contains monthly sales and profit data, with columns for "Sum of Sales" and "Sum of Profit" organized by month.

sum of profit: Summarizes profits by product category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) and includes a separate column repeating these values.

%sales: Shows the percentage of sales distribution by product category (Furniture: ~32%, Office Supplies: ~31%, Technology: ~36%).

sales according to state: Lists sales values by state, indicating state-wise performance.

kpi: Contains various KPIs, including monthly sales, profit, quantity sold, order count, and profit margin percentages by month.

kpi yoy: Year-over-year (YoY) comparison of total sales, profit, order count, profit margin, and quantity sold across multiple years.
